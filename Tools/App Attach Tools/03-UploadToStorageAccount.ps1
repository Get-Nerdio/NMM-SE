.SYNOPSIS
    Uploads MSIX App Attach packages to a specified Azure File Share for use with AVD session hosts.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script connects to Azure, authenticates the user, retrieves a storage account key, 
    and maps an Azure File Share as a network drive on the local system. 
    It then copies App Attach package files (e.g., .cim and .vhdx) from a specified local folder to the Azure File Share.

    The Azure File Share is typically preconfigured as part of your AVD App Attach deployment setup.

    After the upload, the script unmaps the drive to leave the system clean.

.PARAMETER None
    The script prompts interactively for:
        - Resource group name
        - Storage account name
        - File share name
        - Local source folder path

.NOTES
    - Requires the `Az.Accounts` and `Az.Storage` modules (included in the Az PowerShell module).
    - The Azure Storage Account and File Share must already exist and be configured with the required permissions.
    - The executing identity must have permissions to retrieve storage account keys.
    - Refer to Microsoftâ€™s official [MSIX App Attach documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/app-attach-overview) 
      for required permissions and storage setup guidelines.

.CUSTOMIZATION
    - Change `$driveLetter` if Z: is already used or reserved in your environment.
    - Automate input by replacing `Read-Host` with hardcoded variables or script parameters for unattended use.
    - Add logging or validation as needed for production scenarios.
