# Manual Join AzFiles to ADDS

This script is designed to manually join an Azure Files share to an Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) domain. This is an alternative method to the automated process in Nerdio of joining an Azure Files share to an ADDS domain. The script is intended for use in scenarios where the automated process is not feasible or has failed.

## Prerequisites

You need to run this script from a machine that is joined to the domain. Best is to save the **ManualJoinAzFilesToADDS.ps1** script file to a local folder on the machine and open it from Powershell ISE or Visual Studio Code.

Creating a Service Princial you can follow the steps in the following Microsoft documentation: [Create a Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)

In this script we use the Secret and ID of the Service Principal to authenticate to Azure and Microsoft Graph. You can generate a new Secret in the Entra Portal under the Service Principal. Ather generating the Secret you can copy the ID and Secret to the script.

To use a Service Principal to authenticate to Azure and Microsoft Graph, you need to have the following permissions setup for the Service Principal:

**Azure Portal:**
- Azure Subscription: **Contributor** and **Role Based Access Control Administrator**
    - You can also set these permissions on the Resource Group level.
    - When adding the Service Principal to the role search for the Service Principal name instead of the ID.

**Entra Portal:**
- Microsoft Graph: **Group.ReadWrite.All**
    - Look for the Service Principal in the **App Registrations** section, under API permissions you can add the permission. Dont forget to grant admin consent.

## How to Use

The script requires the following parameters to be set:

```powershell
$JoinAzFilesParams = @{
    ServicePrincipal      = $false
    SubscriptionId        = 'Azure Subscription ID'
    ResourceGroupName     = 'Resource Group Name'
    StorageAccountName    = 'Name of Strorage Account'
    FileShareName         = 'Name of File Share in Storage Account'
    StorageAccountKey     = 'Storage Account Key'
    OrganizationUnit      = 'OU=AzFiles,OU=Nerdio Sales,DC=nerdiosales,DC=local' #Example value
    DomainAccountType     = 'ComputerAccount' #ComputerAccount or ServiceLogonAccount default is ComputerAccount
    EncryptionType        = 'AES256'
    TenantID              = 'Tenant ID'
    Debug                 = $false

## Note

If somehow any issue arrise with this script you can always use the steps described in the official Microsoft documentation to join the Azure Files to the ADDS domain. [Join Azure Files to a Windows Server AD domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-ad-ds-enable)
This approach involves a few additional manual steps but serves as a reliable alternative if the script fails due to potential changes from Microsoft. Itâ€™s also advisable to consult the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.
